7. Risks and Mitigations
Technical Risk: Cloud service downtime.
Mitigation: Reputable provider, strong SLA, robust disaster recovery plan.
User Adoption Risk: Difficulty migrating from existing systems.
Mitigation: Seamless and error-tolerant CSV import, excellent onboarding support.
Compliance Risk: Failing to meet HIPAA/GDPR requirements.
Mitigation: Engage a compliance expert early, build auditing into the core architecture.
AI Accuracy Risk: Voice charting incorrectly transcribes clinical data.
Mitigation: Select a best-in-class API, perform extensive real-world testing, and build an easy-to-use correction mechanism for the user.
Data Privacy Risk (Benchmarking): Users perceive the feature as a privacy risk.
Mitigation: Make the feature strictly opt-in with a clear, non-legalese explanation of the anonymization process.
Content Licensing Risk: The educational videos must be sourced and licensed properly.
Mitigation: Finalize the content strategy early: either produce videos in-house or partner with a reputable dental content provider.
Open Question for the Team (Risk): The definition of what must be logged for HIPAA is still high-level. We need to create a definitive list of all PHI access events (view, create, update, delete, export, share) that must be captured in an immutable audit log.
